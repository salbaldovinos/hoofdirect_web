This style guide defines the visual, tonal, and interaction standards for **Hoof Direct**, ensuring consistency across the marketing site (hoofdirect.com), Android app, future iOS app, and supporting materials.

---

## 1. Brand Foundations

### Brand Personality
Hoof Direct should feel:
- **Trustworthy** — Built for professionals who depend on it daily  
- **Practical** — Solves real, field-tested problems  
- **Modern but rugged** — Advanced technology, grounded in real-world work  
- **Quietly confident** — Results-driven, not flashy  

Avoid:
- Startup gimmicks  
- Overly playful or cartoon visuals  
- “Tech bro” language or neon aesthetics  

This is **field-service software**, not a lifestyle app.

---

### Brand Promise (Internal)
> Hoof Direct saves farriers time, miles, and mental overhead—every single day.

This promise should guide all design, UX, and content decisions.

## 2. Color System

### Primary Palette (Earth + Teal)
Designed to align with:
- Equine and agricultural industries  
- Outdoor and rural usage  
- Material 3 fallback colors used in the Android app  

#### Core Colors
| Role | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Green | `#2E7D32` | Primary actions, routes, confirmations |
| Earth Brown | `#6D4C41` | Client/horse accents, grounding elements |
| Teal Accent | `#1565C0` | Route optimization, maps, intelligence highlights |
| Background | `#FFFBFE` | App and site backgrounds |
| Surface | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, panels |
| Outline | `#79747E` | Borders, separators |

**Teal is an accent, not a dominant color.**  
Green and brown should do most of the visual work.

---

### Semantic Color Usage
- **Green** — Actions, success states, routing, confirmations  
- **Teal** — Intelligence, optimization, maps  
- **Brown** — Horses, clients, grounding UI elements  
- **Red** — Errors, overdue invoices only  

Color must never be the only indicator of state or meaning.

## 10. Brand Review Checklist

When reviewing any design, ask:

- Is the primary action obvious?  
- Does it feel calm and dependable?

If yes, it’s on brand.
